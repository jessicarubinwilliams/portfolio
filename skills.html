    <p>Buying my first home was the catalyst for my interest in gardening. My interest in improving the appearance and atmosphere of my yard grew into an interest in native plants. From there I added a vegetable garden. Eventually I removed every bit of grass on my property and turned my yard into a native plant and kitchen garden. A desire to improve my growing skills lead to volunteering on a local certified organic farm...which lead to an internship...which eventually lead to quiting my job for a full-time season-long on-farm internship on another farm. That lead to a full-time season-long on-farm apprenticeship the next year.</p>
    <p>During these years I also supported other growers by managing <a href="https://bloomingtonwinterfarmersmarket.com/">a winter farmers' market</a>. I've worked with the herd at <a href="https://www.traderspointcreamery.com/"></a>an organic dairy. I've farmed with tractors and horses. I helped create and was the first program coordinator for my local food banks' <a href="https://www.hhfoodbank.org/programs/other-food-programs/garden-gleaning/#:~:text=HHFB's%20Garden%20%26%20Gleaning%20programs%20provide,we%20can%20raise%20and%20rescue.">Garden and Gleaning Programs</a>. I've shared my skills and knowledge with other gardeners as the <a href="https://www.bloomingtonmn.gov/pr/bloomington-community-gardens">manager of three community gardens</a>.</p>
    <p>These days I have a rather elaborate ornamental garden and food forest at my current home. My current home is in a warmer <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/hardiness.html">hardiness zone</a> and as a result I've developed a passion for growing dahlias. This fall was my first dividing and storing tubers. I look forward to growing up my stock and perhaps I'll start to dabble in breeding new varieties.</p>
    <p>All this is to say that by following my curiosity I went from being a homeowner with a yard with which she didn't know what to do to an avid hobby gardener to eventually developing my skills enough to becoming a professional grower and gardening educator.</p>

      <h4 class="exciting"><a name="baking"></a>Baking</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Long before I started gardening I learned to bake at the knee of my Grandma Mary and my mom. I'm not sure which I love more: eating my homebaked treats or sharing them with others. One of my fondest memories, which speaks to the joy spread by sharing baked goods, is from the year I lived in Israel and I received a box of homemade chocolate chip cookies from my mom. Those cookies had traveled internationally in not so timely a manner, but the homebaked deliciousnes help up.</p>
    <p>I enjoy baking for others so much that a few years ago I briefly flirted with the idea of opening my own home-based bakery, which I would have named The Piefectionist, under <a href="https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/em9192.pdf">Oregonâ€™s Home Baking Bill</a>. I even played around with making my nacent business a <a href="https://jessicarubinwillia.wixsite.com/piefectionist">website</a>.</p>
    <p>While I've moved on from the idea of starting a bakery and am excited about my current journey learning programming, I feel the way I described myself for that venture still holds true...</p>
    <p class="popout">I believe in love and community and I believe that joy comes in all forms...including the form of baked goods. The guiding philosoply (or the Baking Philosophy if you will) of The Piefectionist is "Spreading Joy Through Baked Goods." I grew up baking with my Jewish grandma in Cleveland, Ohio. I learned to love pie as an adult in South Central Indiana. Nature and nurture collaborated to make me a perfectionist. It all comes together in my love of creating beautiful pies and pastries.</p>
    <p>While I may have started baking things like chocolate chip cookies and chocolate cake as a kid, as an adult my repetoire has expanded. Over the years, first with the help of cookbooks from the library, and later with the help of so many wonderful online blogs and resources, I have followed my curiousity and learned how to bake more and more complex items. Some of my favorites to make are sourdough anything, pies, piecups (tarts), rugalach (apricot!!!), huckleberry or blueberry buckles, and babka (I don't want to start too lively of a debate, but I'm a cinnamon babka fan myself...but I've made plently of chocolate ones for others).</p>

      <p><img class="left" src="img/sandwich-loaf.jpg" alt="A photo of two loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread made with pre-cooked flour or pre-gelatinzed flour.">While I make both free form loaves and loaves in pans, I'm highlighting these whole wheat sandwich loaves as they involved a technique new-to-me that involved pre-cooking some of the flour to pre-gelatinize it. It gave the crumb a wonderful texture. This recipe came from Marizo, the blogger and baker of <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/sourdough-sandwich-bread-with-pre-cooked-flour/">The Perfect Loaf</a>. He is my most trusted bread resource.</p>

      <p><img class="left" src="img/ravioli.jpg" alt="A photo of homemade ravioli, the dough of which was made from sourdough discard.">If you've ever nurtured a sourdough starter you know that you end up with tons of discard. I'm loathe to throw away food, so I like to find ways to use it up. Making sourdough discard pasta dough is one way I love to use it up. Here's a picture of some homemade ravioli I made this fall.</p>
