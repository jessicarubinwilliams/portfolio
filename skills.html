    <p>Buying my first home was the catalyst for my interest in gardening. My interest in improving the appearance and atmosphere of my yard grew into an interest in native plants. From there I added a vegetable garden. Eventually I removed every bit of grass on my property and turned my yard into a native plant and kitchen garden. A desire to improve my growing skills lead to volunteering on a local certified organic farm...which lead to an internship...which eventually lead to quiting my job for a full-time season-long on-farm internship on another farm. That lead to a full-time season-long on-farm apprenticeship the next year.</p>
    <p>During these years I also supported other growers by managing <a href="https://bloomingtonwinterfarmersmarket.com/">a winter farmers' market</a>. I've worked with the herd at <a href="https://www.traderspointcreamery.com/"></a>an organic dairy. I've farmed with tractors and horses. I helped create and was the first program coordinator for my local food banks' <a href="https://www.hhfoodbank.org/programs/other-food-programs/garden-gleaning/#:~:text=HHFB's%20Garden%20%26%20Gleaning%20programs%20provide,we%20can%20raise%20and%20rescue.">Garden and Gleaning Programs</a>. I've shared my skills and knowledge with other gardeners as the <a href="https://www.bloomingtonmn.gov/pr/bloomington-community-gardens">manager of three community gardens</a>.</p>
    <p>These days I have a rather elaborate ornamental garden and food forest at my current home. My current home is in a warmer <a href="https://plants.usda.gov/hardiness.html">hardiness zone</a> and as a result I've developed a passion for growing dahlias. This fall was my first dividing and storing tubers. I look forward to growing up my stock and perhaps I'll start to dabble in breeding new varieties.</p>
    <p>All this is to say that by following my curiosity I went from being a homeowner with a yard with which she didn't know what to do to an avid hobby gardener to eventually developing my skills enough to becoming a professional grower and gardening educator.</p>

Those eyes are so tiny and so hard to see! I'm so grateful to all the wonderful growers who shared their knowledge online, but if I could point you towards just one, it would be <a href="https://www.dahlias.com/help-center/how-to-grow-dahlias/fall-winter">Swan Island Dahlias</a> here in the Willamette Valley.</p>

I don't know if the tuber I purchased was mislabeled or if I got a sport (variant) but either way I love her.</p>

Both for the satisfaction of growing my own and for the delicious taste of fresh picked produce. These tomatoes and peppers were all grown by me in the backyard. If you have a eye for peppers you might notice the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_pepper">ghost peppers</a> in this photo. They were <span class="bg-danger">hot hot hot!</span></p>

      <p><img class="left" src="img/sandwich-loaf.jpg" alt="A photo of two loaves of whole wheat sandwich bread made with pre-cooked flour or pre-gelatinzed flour.">While I make both free form loaves and loaves in pans, I'm highlighting these whole wheat sandwich loaves as they involved a technique new-to-me that involved pre-cooking some of the flour to pre-gelatinize it. It gave the crumb a wonderful texture. This recipe came from Marizo, the blogger and baker of <a href="https://www.theperfectloaf.com/sourdough-sandwich-bread-with-pre-cooked-flour/">The Perfect Loaf</a>. He is my most trusted bread resource.</p>

      <p><img class="left" src="img/ravioli.jpg" alt="A photo of homemade ravioli, the dough of which was made from sourdough discard.">If you've ever nurtured a sourdough starter you know that you end up with tons of discard. I'm loathe to throw away food, so I like to find ways to use it up. Making sourdough discard pasta dough is one way I love to use it up. Here's a picture of some homemade ravioli I made this fall.</p>
