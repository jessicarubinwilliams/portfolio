      <h4>I'm person who loves the details. I love learning how things work, the logic behind a rule or best practice, and how to create things from scratch.</h4>
      <p>How this plays out in life is that when I am interested in something I take a deep dive.</p>
    </div>
    <p>My love of learning how things work and how to make things combined with my love of details is what makes learning programming a good fit. As I searched for a career that would utilize my natural talents and suit my mind set my research kept pointing towards programming.</p>
    <p>As a detail-oriented person I began by exploring <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming">Epicodus' free online curriculum</a>. And when I discovered how much I enjoyed it I enrolled in the <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus Boot Camp.</a></p>
