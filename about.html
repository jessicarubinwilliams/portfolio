      <h4>I'm a person who <span class="important">loves</span> the details. I love learning how things work, the logic behind a rule or best practice, and how to create things from scratch.</h4>
      <p>How this plays out in life is that when I am interested in something I take a deep dive.</p>
    </div>
    <p>My love of learning how things work and learning how to make things combined with my love of details are the reasons <em>learning programming is a great fit for me!</em> As I searched for a career that would utilize my natural talents and suit my mind set my research kept pointing towards programming.</p>
    <p>As a detail-oriented person, before making a big life change and enrolling in a programming educational program, I began by exploring <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming">Epicodus' free online curriculum</a>. And when this self-directed study confirmed that <span class="exciting">I enjoy programming</span>, I enrolled in the <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus Boot Camp.</a></p>
    <p>When I'm not learning to program or working on one of my elaborate hobbies I am probably playing with or defending my meal from one of my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jellybeanprettykitty/">four pets</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jellybean - a soft, fuzzy, sassy long-haired domestic cat</li>
      <li>Honey - an adorable, hilarious, high-strung (yappy and nippy) doxie-cairn</li>
      <li>Rusty - a beautiful short-haired red border collie with high anxiety and a never ending desire to put smaller animals in his mouth</li>
      <li>George - a cantankerous yet snuggly domestic cat</li>
    </ul>
